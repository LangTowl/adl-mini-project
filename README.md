### Objective
---
Develop a deep learning model for object detection to identify and localize objects like cars, pedestrians, and cyclists in real-world urban driving scenes using the **KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite dataset**. This project introduces students to state-of-the-art techniques for object detection in autonomous vehicles.

### Project Description
---
1. **Problem Statement:**  
	 - Autonomous vehicles need to detect and localize surrounding objects accurately to navigate safely. Object detection involves identifying objects in an image and drawing bounding boxes around them with class labels.  
	- Students will use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects in images from the KITTI dataset.  
2. **Dataset:**  
	 - **KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite:**  
		- Includes images from urban, rural, and highway scenarios captured using a car-mounted camera.  
		- Contains labeled bounding boxes for classes such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
	- Download the dataset from [KITTI's official website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).  
3. **Preprocessing:**  
	- Parse and load KITTI dataset annotations (bounding boxes and labels).  
	- Normalize images and resize them to a fixed size suitable for the model (e.g., 300x300 or 416x416 pixels).  
	- Data augmentation techniques:  
		- Random cropping, flipping, and scaling to increase model robustness.  
		- Adjust brightness and contrast for lighting variations.  
4. **Model Architecture:**  
	- Use a pre-trained object detection model such as:  
		- Single Shot Detector (SSD).  
		- You Only Look Once (YOLO).  
		- Faster R-CNN.  
	- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the KITTI dataset.  
	- Key components of the model:  
		- Feature Extractor: A CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to extract features from images.  
		- Bounding Box Regression: Predict object bounding boxes.  
		- Classification Head: Predict the class labels for detected objects.  
5. **Training:**  
	- Use the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric for evaluating bounding box predictions.  
	- Optimize the model with a loss function combining:  
		- Localization Loss: For bounding box regression.  
		- Classification Loss: For predicting correct object classes.  
	- Employ techniques like transfer learning to speed up training.  
6. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
	- Mean Average Precision (mAP): Evaluate detection performance across classes.  
	- IoU thresholds (e.g., 0.5): Measure the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.  
7. **Tools and Frameworks:**  
	- Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning model implementation.  
	- OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization.  
	- Matplotlib/Seaborn for plotting metrics.  
8. **Implementation Steps:**  
	- Load and preprocess KITTI dataset images and labels.  
	- Implement and train an object detection model (e.g., SSD, YOLO).  
	- Evaluate model performance on the test set.  
	- Visualize detected objects with bounding boxes on sample images.  
9. **Extensions:**  
	- Experiment with different backbone architectures (e.g., MobileNet for faster inference).  
	- Test the model on other datasets or real-world scenarios.
	- Integrate the model into a driving simulator for real-time testing.
